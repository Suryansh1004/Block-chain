#### 1.1 Focus Area : Reinforce theoretical concepts and Experimentation.
#### 1.2 About the Experiment
<br/>
In this experiment, the simulator will demonstrate the  concept of mining. First, the user has to perform a task where he will be recalling his knowledge on mining.
Then simulator will show how process of mining is done once the block is ready to be validated and added into the blockchain. And how the process of rewarding the fastest miner works in 
blockchain.

#### 1.3 Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr No. |    Learning Objective  | Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Recall the concept of Mining by matching the steps of mining process in correct order. | Remember | Recall
2.| User will be able to: <br>Describe how a transaction is validated and added <br>to the main blockchain. | Understand| Describe
3.| User will be able to: <br>Identify how the process of hashing is used in mining and what role does it play. | Apply | Identify
4.| User will be able to: <br>Analyze the concept of rewarding the miner i.e. the <br>miner who is first in calculating the hash and hence validating a block. | Analyse | Analyze

<h3> 2 Instructional Strategy</h3>
<h4> 2.1 Name of Instructional Strategy  : </h4>    <u> Expository.</u>
<h4> 2.2 Assessment Method:</h4> <u>Formative Assessment.</u>
<h4> 2.3 Description: </h4>
    In this experiment, the user will learn about mining in blockchain i.e. how a transaction is validated and added into a blockchain.
    He/she will learn how the process of hashing helps in validation of a block.He/she will also get to know which miner is rewarded when a block is validated and added to the blockchain.

#### 3 Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment.
<br>

Sr No. |    Learning Objective  | Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Recall the concept of Mining by matching the steps of mining process in correct order. | Match the steps provided by the simulator to there corresponding step number in the mining process. | <div align="justify">In the given task, the user tries to connect the steps on the left side to the right side in a correct manner. If the user is unable to connect blocks in the correct order then the user has to go back to the theory section.(Assessment Task)<br>
2.| User will be able to: <br>Describe how a transaction is validated and added <br>to the main blockchain. | User creates transaction blocks by entering information in the placeholder, and then he can also create further blocks if it was not clear to him/her before. |<div align="justify"> i. Where the user can visualize, that the block is added?  <br> ii. How a block is validated? <br>iii. How the validated block can be added to the main blockchain?<br>
3.| User will be able to: <br>Identify how the process of hashing is used in mining and what role does it play. |User will be performing a task, where he/she will be clicking on the Start Mining Process button to start the mining process.|<div align="justify"> <div align="justify"> i. Which Algorithm of the cryptographic domain is used in Mining?<br>ii. What role does cryptographic domain play here? <br>iii. Can some other algorithm implemented in this experiment?<br>
4.| User will be able to: <br>Analyze the concept of rewarding the miner i.e. the <br>miner who is first in calculating the hash and hence validating a block. | User will analyze how the mining process has completed and the first miner was rewarded for his fast validation. |<div align="justify"><br> i. When the miner completed his task, where did he got the reward from? <br> ii. How does the process of rewarding the first miner takes place? <br>

#### 4. Simulator Interactions :

<br>

Sr No. |	What students will do?	|  What simulator will do? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will perform a task based on recalling the process of mining. In that task, the user will match the contents present on the left side to the contents present at the right side according to the concept of mining. | Simulator will display whether the user has correctly matched the left pane contents to the right pane contents or not. | <div align="justify"> User will recall the concept of Mining. <br> 
2.| User will enter the details of the first transaction and press submit button. This task can be repeated by the user for desired number of times.  | <div align="justify"> Simulator will add the transaction details onto the current block after user has clicked the submit button. | <div align = "justify">To help the user understand how the transaction data is added onto the block  . <br>
3.| Now the user will click on start mining process button.  | Simulator will display that the mining process has been started by the miners. <br>After a few seconds simulator will show the completioon of mining process. |<div align="justify"> User will watch the hash being calculated by all the three miners. <br>
4.| The user will now analyze the result once hash is calculated.  | Simulator will show which miner was the first to complete the mining process and will be rewarded accordingly.  |<div align="justify"> User will learn the working of rewardiing feature of mining. <br>
