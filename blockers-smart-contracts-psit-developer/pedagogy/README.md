#### 1.1 Focus Area : Reinforce theoretical concepts and Experimentation
#### 1.2 About the Experiment
<br/>
In this experiment, the simulator will illustrate the Smart Contracts in Blockchain.
Initially, we have a task that will help
user to recall<br> his knowledge on Smart Contracts and then an interactive
representation through the simulator that will the help user to enhance<br> his/her concepts by creating and observing a smart contract in Blockchain.

#### 1.3 Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr No. |    Learning Objective  | Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Recall the concept of Smart Contracts by<br> selecting the correct order of the proocess of smart contracts in blockchain. | Remember | Recall
2.| User will be able to: <br>Describe how smart contracts are implemented in blockchain. | Understand| Describe
3.| User will be able to: <br>Categorize the various processes of smart contract and learn its <br>implementation in blockchain. | Analyze| Categorize

<h4> 2.2 Assessment Method:</h4> <u>Formative Assessment.</u>
<h4> 2.3 Description: </h4>
    In this experiment, the user will learn about Smart Contracts in blockchain.He/She will learn how a smart contract is 
    implemented in blockchain and what advantages it has over third party contracts.

#### 3 Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment.
<br>

Sr No. |    Learning Objective  | Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Recall the concept of Smart Contracts <br>by selecting the correct order of the code of smart contracts. | User has to select the codes from the left side and they will be added in the right side. So  he has to arrange theem in the correct order and only the task that are a part of the code as there are extra steps given to increase the difficulty.  | <div align="justify">i. In the given task, the user tries to correctly complete the  exercise. If the user is unable to complete the exercise, he can go back to the theory section or continue with the experiment.<br>
2.| User will be able to: <br>Describe how smart contracts are implemented in blockchain. |User has to enter the name of sender and he should enter "A" as the reciever if he wants the given condition to come true or if we does not fill "A" as reciever the transactions will continue to happen.  |<div align="justify"> i. Will the smart contract be initiated if the money given to A is sent to some other user after it reached 100?<br> 
3.| User will be able to: <br>Categorize the various processes of smart contract and learn its implementation in blockchain. | Firstly the user has to fill in the details of the smart contract he wants that are name of donation camp, name of reciever of the funds, then he/she has to perform transaction to achieve the terms he/she has provided by sending the required amount of money he/she specified earlier in the set time to activate the contract.   |<div align="justify">i. What will happen if the donation amount  has not  reached the given limit?<br>ii. Who recieves the money first the campaign or the user?

#### 4. Simulator Interactions :

<br>

Sr No. |	What students will do?	|  What simulator will do? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| In the given task, the user tries to put the steps of the smart contracts code in the correct order by slecting them from  the left side . | Simulator tells the user whether the order of the code is correct or not. | <div align="justify"> User will recall the concept of Smart Contracts in Blockhain. <br>
2.| In the given task, there is a smart contract already in place with a condition checking if the balance of 'A' is equal to or more than $100. Starting balance of 'A' is $0, the user's task is to perform transactions to 'A' until A's balance reaches $100 or more.  | <div align="justify"> When 'A' gets a balance of $100 or more, a notification is shown to the user signifying that the smart contract conditions has been met. | <div align = "justify">This task will make the user understand how a smart contract is initiated when its conditions are met. <br>
3.| In the next task, a real life example of smart contract is given, a donation campaign. The details about the donation campaign smart contract has been described in the simulator, user's task is to set the conditions for the smart contract, such as time limit, receiver of the donations, the name of the donation campaign etc. and then user proceeds to the next task. | The simulator will construct a smart contract based on the inputs given by the user and then prompt him to the next task. |<div align="justify"> User will understand how smart contracts are entered into the blockchain. <br>
4.| In this task, user will make transactions(donations) to the donation campaign until the conditions set by him/her are met.  | Simulator will alow the transactions to happen till the timer is running and keep calculating the total amount recieved by the donation campaign. Once the timer has stopped, it will tell whether the conditions provided by the user are met or not. If the conditions are not met, the donations are refunded to the donators and if the conditions are met, the donation amount is forwarded to the receiver. | <div align = "justify"> By performing this example user will understand the complete working of Smart Contracts in blockchain.
