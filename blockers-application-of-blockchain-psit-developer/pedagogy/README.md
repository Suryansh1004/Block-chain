#### 1.1 Focus Area : Reinforce theoretical concepts and Experimentation
#### 1.2 About the Experiment
<br/>
In this experiment, the simulator will illustrate wokring of blockchain by 
a working model of blockchain.<br> Initially, we have a task that will help
user to recall his knowledge on Blockchain and then he will<br> move to the other section where we have 
the working model of blockchain and there user can experiment with and learn.<br><br>

<h3> 2 Instructional Strategy</h3>
<h4> 2.1 Name of Instructional Strategy  : </h4>    <u> Expository.</u>
<h4> 2.2 Assessment Method:</h4> <u>Formative Assessment.</u>
<h4> 2.3 Description: </h4>
    In this experiment, the user will learn and experiment with real time example of blockchain. He/she will also be able to see<br> 
    how the hashing algorithm SHA-256 is implemented in Blockchain in real.He/she will learn how one has to change all the blocks of<br> 
    blockchain if he/she renders or makes any changes in one of them. And this process he has to do in all the chains there exist to<br> 
    make it a valid change.

#### 3 Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment.
<br>

Sr No. |    Learning Objective  | Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Recall the concept of Blockchain by<br> by arranging the blocks in correct order. | User has to click on the arrow buttons on the right of the blocks to move them up and down in the chain. And click validate when he has put them in correct order to verify his result. | <div align="justify">i.In the given task, the user tries to correctly complete the task. If the user is unable to complete the task, he can go back to the theory section or continue with the experiment.<br>
2.| User will be able to: <br>Describe how the blockchain works in real time. | User has to make changes in the data column of blockchain provided in simulator to see how all the blocks are connected to each other through hash. |<div align="justify"> i. User has to make valid changes  in the blockchain.<br> 
3.| User will be able to: <br>Describe how change in one block can invalidate whole chain. | User has to make changes in the data column of blockchain provided in the simulator to see how changes are made in blockchain.  |<div align="justify">i. User has to make valid changes  in the blockchain.<br> 
4.| User will be able to: <br>Describe what is the use of nonce difficulty. | User has select a difficulty level from the dropdown given in the simulator which means the number of zeroes before the hash to make it more coomplex.  |<div align="justify">i. User will now has to change the level of difficulty by the dropdown provided above and learn by increasing the difficulty the time elapsed in hashing is also increased.
5.| User will be able to: <br>Experiment with hashing with SHA-256 in real time. | User has to click on 'MINE' button on the block he wants to be validated.  |<div align="justify">i. User will now has to change the level of difficulty by the dropdown provided above and learn by increasing the difficulty the time elapsed in hashing is also increased.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions :

<br>

Sr No. |	What students will do?	|  What simulator will do? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| In the given task, the user tries to arrange the given blocks in their correct oorder in blockchain. | Simulator tells the user whether the oredr of the blocks is correct or not. | <div align="justify"> User will recall the concept of Blockchain. <br> 
2.| User will first make a change in the data column of the block.  | <div align="justify"> Once the user has made some changes in the blockchain the whole chain after that particular name turns red. | <div align = "justify">User will learn that when a change is made in blockchain all the blocks following it will turn red hence depicting that the chain in not validated. <br>
3.| After making changes in the the data section now the user has to click on 'MINE' button. | When the user clicks on the 'MINE' button the in built hashing algorithm namely SHA-256 starts calculating the valid hash for the given data or changed data. |<div align="justify"> User will understand how invalid blocks are converted to valid blocks by process of mining.<br>
4.| Now, User can changes the difficulty from the nonce dropdown given above. | The simulator will now calculate the hash of the block starting with number of zeroes (nonce) as entered by the user in dropdown. | The user will learn how by increasing the nonce the time period taken by miners to block increases.
