 <h3>Blockchain Technology</h3>
                     A blockchain is basically a living list of records, called as "blocks". These blocks are connected to each other by the diverse cryptographic mechanisms. In the category of data structures, this can be related to the concept of a Linked List. In Blockchain, the initial block is known as the "Genesis Block". This naming convention is basically a major commendation to Satoshi Nakamoto. The domain of crypto-currency was pioneered by a bogus naming convention. It can be related to a random scenario of a person or a group of persons, represented by a peculiar name “Satoshi Nakamoto”. In the year 2008, for the purpose of Bitcoin this name was utilized. The technology that was used behind the Bitcoin spectrum was “Block-Chain”. Initially the structure of a block has basically 3 components namely data, hash of current block and hash of previous block. 
As an illustration in general, the concept of block-chain can be depicted with “m” blocks forming a chain where m can be any random positive integer.<br><br>
<h3>Three pillars of blockchain</h3>
                    <h4>Decentralization</h4> The true meaning of decentralization is not having a central unit. Now if we take this concept in Blockchain it means that blockchain 
                   is autonomous and does not have a central governing unit.
                   <h4>Transparency</h4>Transparency in real life means something with zero opacity. Now if we take this concept in Blockchain, it means that blockchain
                    has zero privacy to be exact when we talk about transactions, all the transactions are public and can be viewed by anyone on the network.
                    <h4>Immutability</h4>Here immutable means exactly what the  word means in any real life i.e. something that cannnot be altered. So when we talk about 
                    blockchain it means that once a transaction is pushed into blockchain it cannot be altered.
                    
<h3>Elements of Blockchain</h3>
                     <h4>Smart-Contracts in Blockchain</h4>
The origin of the Smart-Contract began in the early 1990's by a versatile computer scientist "Nick Szabo". He is also an expert of the cryptographic domain. With the help of this concept, the user or anyone can avoid the  frauds of a middle men. It can allow anyone to trade currency, property or any valuable thing in a hassle-free manner. The user can compare it with a concept of C-Language i.e. "if-else statement". Same here happens, If one condition is fulfilled,then a particular condition will take place and if a particular condition is not met then, some other task will take place. The smart contracts are commited as codes. That simply means that, when an outline of an event takes place the smart contracts are triggered. For example, if in a corporate private organization, the targets are reached then the bonus will be given to the employees. Here, the bonus is basically the process happened when the code of target is completed. Syntactically, the principle is "if/when....then...", that means if a particular condition is met then a particular action will take place.
<h3>Advantages of Smart Contracts</h3>
There are basically 5 benifits of Smart Contracts that are discussed below:<br>
1.  Pace<br>
2.  Correctness<br>
3.  Belief<br>
4.  Certainty<br>
5.  Economizing<br>   
                     <h4>Consensus Model</h4> This model basically deals with the soundness as well as safety of the blockchain. The primitive condition to be followed for this is to be consistent across the shared state.
                     Consensus is a vital approach because without a medial power, the users must follow the protocols and how to solicit them.
                     <h4>Public & Private Blockchain </h4>In general any transaction is pushed to the public blockchain where user is not known. A blockchain which is owned 
                     by a  enterprise/company is called a private blockchain here user is known. Private blockchain is comparatively faster than public blockchain because of less users.

<h3>Functioning of Blockchain Technology</h3>
                     Decentralization, Transparency, Immutability are the three pillars of blockchain technology. Efficiency as well as cost can be optimised using this approach. The use as well as request of softwares or applications that are made  on blockchain architecture will only advance. A hash can be compared with a fingerprint (that is totally unique). A very popular cryptographic approach that is Secure Hash Algorithm (256) is used to formulate the hash value. Hash Value is basically the amalgamation of the numeric and the alphabetical data. This generation of hash is the primitive approach to understand blockchain. At that instant,when a block is generated, a hash has been produced for the same, and if any change has been done in the block, it will certainly affect the hash value too. With the mechanism of hashing, the changes are easily identified.
                     The ultimate verdict within the block is the hash value from a predecessor. Fortunately, by the means of this a chain of blocks is created that is the strategy behind blockchain's architecture.

                     <h3>Mining </h3>
                   In terms of the block chain domain, mining is the procedure of appending transactions to an enormous distributed ledger of extant transactions. This concept is well suited for the bitcoin approach but the diverse technologies that uses the block chain approach can also perform the approach of mining as well. It allows the creation of a hash for a block of transactions that cannot be changed easily protecting the integrity approach of the block chain. The concept of mining goes really well with the other two approaches that are open ledger and distributed ledger.
                   Miners keep the blockchain consistent, complete, and unalterable by repeatedly grouping newly broadcast transactions into a block, which is then broadcast to the network and verified by recipient nodes. Each block contains a SHA-256 cryptographic hash of the previous block,thus linking it to the previous block and giving the blockchain its name.<br><br>
<h3>Some Basic Algorithmic Rules Used</h3>
<h3>SHA-256 and ECDSA</h3>
                    SHA-256 or Secure Hash Algorithm-256 bit is a type of hash function which is commonly used in Blockchain. SHA-256 changes an input from the user to a string which is a mixture of numbers and letter which is created through a cryptographically secure hashing function which is almost 0% similar to the input. SHA-256 is the strongest hash function available in the current scenario and it is a successor of SHA-1.<br>
                    Eg:- SHA-256 hash of 'abc' will be 'ba7816bf­8f01cfea­414140de­5dae2223­b00361a3­96177a9c­b410ff61­f20015ad'<br>
                    ECDSA stands for Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. ECDSA consists of three parts.<br>
                    &#9679;&nbsp;Private Key<br>
                    &#9679;&nbsp;Public Key<br>
                    &#9679;&nbsp;Signature<br><br>
                    <b>Private Key :- </b>It is a number in form of secret key which is known only to the person who owns it and does transactions. Private Key is a randomly generated number which is a single unsigned 256 bit integer.<br>
                    <b>Public Key :- </b>It is a number generated from Private Key but is not kept secret. A public Key can be determined from Private Key but Private Key cannot be determined from Public Key. A Public Key can be used to determine whether a Signature is genuine or not without requiring Private Key.<br>
                    <b>Signature :- </b>It is a number that confirms about a signing operation taking place. A Signature is a mathematically generated hash of the signed number and Priavte Key. A Public Key is used to determine whether the signature entered is genuine or not which provides security to the transactions.<br><br>

<h3>Consensus Mechanism</h3>
                    A consensus mechanism is a fault-tolerant mechanism that is used in computer and blockchain systems to achieve the necessary
                    agreement on a single data value or a single state of the network among distributed processes or multi-agent systems, 
                    such as with cryptocurrencies. It is useful in record-keeping, among other things.
<h4>Proof of Work</h4>
                     This consensus algorithmic rule deals with the prevention of raw facts & figures, in blocks from tampering. By this mechanism, the blocks can be appended into a chain in a perpetual manner. Hashing as well as linking are the domains of safety in blockchain. A brief idea, of the hashing algorithmic rules have been understood by the user in the previous experiment (experiment no.2). For appending the blocks in the blockchain, the miners are provided with some tricky mathematical puzzles. The first miner to solve the puzzle, gets a reward that is based on some policy. One must understand that there should be enough computational power to solve that tricky mathematical puzzle.
                     After the solving of the puzzle, the blocks get added to chain thus forming blockchain.<br>
                     Proof of work is a consensus algorithm in blockchain technology. In Blockchain, miners use this algorithm to confirm transactions and create new blocks in the blockchain. With proof of work, miners try and compete against others to confirm the transaction in less time to get rewarded. For that miners have to solve a complex mathematical puzzle. 
                     Bitcoin is the most famous application of proof of work. In Blockchain it takes 10 minutes for the creation of Blockchain. 
    <h4>Proof of Stake</h4>
                     It is an alternative measure to the Proof of Work (Pow). To achieve the objective of the distributed consensus this algorithmic rule can be used. In this mechanism, the validation of blocks takes place. PoS is somehow, less risky in comparison to the other protocol mentioned. Everything under this mechanism, holds a principle that “Proportions of Coins held by the miner”.<br>The Proof of Stake (PoS) seeks to address this issue by attributing mining power to the proportion of coins held by a miner. This way, instead of utilizing energy to answer PoW puzzles, a PoS miner is limited to mining a percentage of transactions that is reflective of his or her ownership stake.With a PoS, the attacker would need to obtain 51% of the cryptocurrency to carry out a 51% attack. The Proof of Stake avoids this by making it disadvantageous for a miner with a 51% stake in a cryptocurrency to attack the network.
