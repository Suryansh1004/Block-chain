#### 1.1 Focus Area : Reinforce theoretical concepts and Experimentation.
#### 1.2 About the Experiment
<br/>
In this experiment, the simulator will differentiate between two main selection criteria of blockchain, namely Proof of Work(PoW) and Proof of Stake(PoS). Initially, there is a task that will help user to recall his/her knowledge on both of the concepts through 'Fill in the Blanks' exercise. Then through a practical implementation of both these concepts, user learns about them in detail.

<h3> 2 Instructional Strategy</h3>
<h4> 2.1 Name of Instructional Strategy  : </h4>    <u> Expository.</u>
<h4> 2.2 Assessment Method:</h4> <u>Formative Assessment.</u>
<h4> 2.3 Description: </h4>
    In this experiment, the user will learn about Proof of Stake and Proof of Work. The simulator will demonstrate the working of both these algorithms by one short example of each concept. Apart from that, he/she will also be able to recall concepts with the help of a Fill in the Blanks exercise.

#### 3 Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment.
<br>

Sr No. |    Learning Objective  | Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Recall the concept of Proof of Work(PoW) <br>by selecting the correct order of the process of proof of work. | User has to select the operations/steps from the left side and they will be added in the right side. So  he has to arrange theem in the correct order and only the task that are a part of the process as there are extra steps given to increase the difficulty.  | <div align="justify">i. In the given task, the user tries to correctly complete the  exercise. If the user is unable to complete the exercise, he can go back to the theory section or continue with the experiment.<br>
2.| User will be able to: <br>Recall the concept of Proof of Stake(PoS) <br>by selecting the correct order of the process of proof of stake. | User has to select the operations/steps from the left side and they will be added in the right side. So  he has to arrange theem in the correct order and only the task that are a part of the process as there are extra steps given to increase the difficulty.  | <div align="justify">i. In the given task, the user tries to correctly complete the  exercise. If the user is unable to complete the exercise, he can go back to the theory section or continue with the experiment.<br>
3.| User will be able to: <br>Describe how the consensus algorithm "Proof of Work"<br>is used in mining the blocks in blockchain. | User enters transaction information and can also add multiple blocks consisting of transactions. User will be able to add miners in the blockchain. |<div align="justify"> i. User will be adding multiple miners to the pool to verify that the chance of a miner getting selected in totally random.<br> 
4.| User will be able to: <br>Describe how the consensus algorithm "Proof of Stake"<br>is used in validating the blocks in blockchain. | User enters transaction information and can also add multiple blocks consisting of transactions. User will be able to add validators with their specific stake in the blockchain. |<div align="justify">i. User will be performing a task, where he/she will be adding validators with specific stake to check that chance of getting selected for validating a block depends upon the stake.
5.| User will be able to: <br>Distinguish between Proof of Work and Proof of Stake. | User will distribute the given statements among the two columns, namely of PoW and PoS. |<div align="justify"> i.User has to complete the task of distribution and if he fails he would have to go back to the start of the simulator.<br>

#### 4. Simulator Interactions :

<br>

Sr No. |	What students will do?	|  What simulator will do? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| In the given task, the user tries to put the steps of the proof of work process in the correct order by slecting them from  the left side . | Simulator tells the user whether the order of the process is correct or not. | <div align="justify"> User will recall the concept of Proof of Work. <br> 
2.| In the given task, the user tries to put the steps of the proof of stake process in the correct order by slecting them from  the left side . | Simulator tells the user whether the order of the process is correct or not. | <div align="justify"> User will recall the concept of Proof of Stake. <br> 
3.| User will enter the details of the first transaction and press submit button. Now, the user can repeat this task and as many transactions as he/she wants. | <div align="justify"> Simulator will create the transaction according to the details entered by the user and add them to the block. | <div align = "justify">This tells the user a transaction is not validated when it's entering into the block. <br>
4.| User will be either clicking on the start mining process or first adding few miners to the pool then then clicking on the start mining process button  .  | Simulator will start the mining process or first add miners if user has clicked on add miner button. |<div align="justify"> User will learn that the chance of a miner mining the block is random. <br>
5.| User will enter the details of the first transaction and press submit button. Now, the user can repeat this task and as many transactions as he/she wants. | <div align="justify"> Simulator will create the transaction according to the details entered by the user and add them to the block. | <div align = "justify">This tells the user a transaction is not validated when it's entering into the block. <br>
6.| User will be either clicking on the start validating process or first adding few validators with the stake they hold then then clicking on the start validating process button  .  | Simulator will start the validating process or first add validators if user has clicked on add validator button. |<div align="justify"> User will learn that the chance of a validator getting selected depends upon the stake they hold. <br>
7.| User will first click on the statement on the left and then on the column of PoS or PoW as per his wish and continue till all the statemnts have been distributed and then verify his answers by clicking on the validate button.  | After clicking the validate button the simulator tells the user whether his answers are right or wrong. |<div align="justify"> User  will test what bhe has understood in the previous sections. <br>
