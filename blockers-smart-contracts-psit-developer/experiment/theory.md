 <h3>Blockchain Technology</h3>
                     A block chain is basically a living list of records, called as "blocks". These blocks are connected to each other by the diverse cryptographic mechanisms. In the category of data structures, this can be related to the concept of a Linked List. In Block chain, the initial block is known as the "Genesis Block". This naming convention is basically a major commendation to Satoshi Nakamoto. The domain of crypto-currency was pioneered by a bogus naming convention. It can be related to a random scenario of a person or a group of persons, represented by a peculiar name “Satoshi Nakamoto”. In the year 2008, for the purpose of Bitcoin this name was utilized. The technology that was used behind the Bitcoin spectrum was “Block-Chain”. Initially the structure of a block has basically 3 components namely data, hash of current block and hash of previous block. As an illustration in general, the concept of block-chain can be depicted with “m” blocks forming a chain where m can be any random positive integer.

<h4>Smart-Contracts in Blockchain</h4>
The origin of the Smart-Contract began in the early 1990's by a versatile computer scientist "Nick Szabo". He is also an expert of the cryptographic domain. With the help of this concept, the user or anyone can avoid the  frauds of a middle men. It can allow anyone to trade currency, property or any valuable thing in a hassle-free manner. The user can compare it with a concept of C-Language i.e. "if-else statement". Same here happens, If one condition is fulfilled,then a particular condition will take place and if a particular condition is not met then, some other task will take place. The smart contracts are commited as codes. That simply means that, when an outline of an event takes place the smart contracts are triggered. For example, if in a corporate private organization, the targets are reached then the bonus will be given to the employees. Here, the bonus is basically the process happened when the code of target is completed. Syntactically, the principle is "if/when....then...", that means if a particular condition is met then a particular action will take place.

<h3>Advantages of Smart Contracts</h3>
There are basically 5 benifits of Smart Contracts that are discussed below:<br>
1.  Pace<br>
2.  Correctness<br>
3.  Belief<br>
4.  Certainty<br>
5.  Economizing<br>


<h3>Some Basic Algorithmic Rules Used</h3>
<h3>SHA-256 and ECDSA</h3>
                    SHA-256 or Secure Hash Algorithm-256 bit is a type of hash function which is commonly used in Blockchain. SHA-256 changes an input from the user to a string which is a mixture of numbers and letter which is created through a cryptographically secure hashing function which is almost 0% similar to the input. SHA-256 is the strongest hash function available in the current scenario and it is a successor of SHA-1.<br>
                    Eg:- SHA-256 hash of 'abc' will be 'ba7816bf­8f01cfea­414140de­5dae2223­b00361a3­96177a9c­b410ff61­f20015ad'<br>
                    ECDSA stands for Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. ECDSA consists of three parts.<br>
                    &#9679;&nbsp;Private Key<br>
                    &#9679;&nbsp;Public Key<br>
                    &#9679;&nbsp;Signature<br><br>
                    <b>Private Key :- </b>It is a number in form of secret key which is known only to the person who owns it and does transactions. Private Key is a randomly generated number which is a single unsigned 256 bit integer.<br>
                    <b>Public Key :- </b>It is a number generated from Private Key but is not kept secret. A public Key can be determined from Private Key but Private Key cannot be determined from Public Key. A Public Key can be used to determine whether a Signature is genuine or not without requiring Private Key.<br>
                    <b>Signature :- </b>It is a number that confirms about a signing operation taking place. A Signature is a mathematically generated hash of the signed number and Priavte Key. A Public Key is used to determine whether the signature entered is genuine or not which provides security to the transactions.<br><br>
