<h4>Steps of simulator </h4><br>
                        1. Start with the task regarding concepts of Blockchain.<br>
                        2. Click on the word that you want to be inserted.<br>
                        3. Click on the blank where the previously entered word is to be inserted.<br>

                        5. Click in the hint button to get the hint of the wrong question if any and repeat the above process to get all the right answers.<br>
                        6. Click on the "Initiate Blockchain" button to go to the experiment page. <br>
                        7. Now select the Hash Difficulty Level from the dropdown menu on the simulator this will set the number of zeroes before the hash 
                        and increase the time taken by miner to calcutlate the hash so if you don't have much time, it is advised to keep it below 3.<br>
                        8. After that enter the data in the data field this will inavalidate the block hence creating an error in blockchain. <br>
                        9. Now click on the "Mine" button to generate valid hash regarding the entered value and then start the proces of mining.<br>
                        10. The instruction pane will also be there to make the user understand about the basic process that is happening in the simulator. <br>
