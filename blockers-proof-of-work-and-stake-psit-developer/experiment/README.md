### Theory
 <h3>What is Blockchain Technology?</h3>
                     A block chain is basically a living list of records, called as "blocks". These blocks are connected to each other by the diverse cryptographic mechanisms. In the category of data structures, this can be related to the concept of a Linked List. In Block chain, the initial block is known as the "Genesis Block". This naming convention is basically a major commendation to Satoshi Nakamoto. The domain of crypto-currency was pioneered by a bogus naming convention. It can be related to a random scenario of a person or a group of persons, represented by a peculiar name “Satoshi Nakamoto”. In the year 2008, for the purpose of Bitcoin this name was utilized. The technology that was used behind the Bitcoin spectrum was “Block-Chain”. Initially the structure of a block has basically 3 components namely data, hash of current block and hash of previous block. As an illustration in general, the concept of block-chain can be depicted with “m” blocks forming a chain where m can be any random positive integer.

<h3>Three pillars of blockchain</h3>
                    <h4>Decentralization</h4> The true meaning of decentralization is not having a central unit. Now if we take this concept in Blockchain it means that blockchain 
                   is autonomous and does not have a central governing unit.
                   <h4>Transparency</h4>Transparency in real life means something with zero opacity. Now if we take this concept in Blockchain, it means that blockchain
                    has zero privacy to be exact when we talk about transactions, all the transactions are public and can be viewed by anyone on the network.
                    <h4>Immutability</h4>Here immutable means exactly what the  word means in any real life i.e. something that cannnot be altered. So when we talk about 
                    blockchain it means that once a transaction is pushed into blockchain it cannot be altered.
    <h4>Consensus Model</h4>
                     This model basically deals with the soundness as well as safety of the blockchain. The primitive condition to be followed for this is to be consistent across the shared state.
                     Consensus is a vital approach because without a medial power, the users must follow the protocols and how to solicit them.
                     <h4>Mining</h4>In terms of the block chain domain, mining is the procedure of appending transactions to an enormous distributed ledger of extant transactions. This concept is well suited for the bitcoin approach but the diverse technologies that uses the blockchain approach can also perform the approach of mining as well. It allows the creation of a hash for a block of transactions that cannot be changed easily protecting the integrity approach of the block chain. The concept of mining goes really well with the other two approaches that are open ledger and distributed ledger.
    <h4>Proof of Work</h4>
                     This consensus algorithmic rule deals with the prevention of raw facts & figures, in blocks from tampering. By this mechanism, the blocks can be appended into a chain in a perpetual manner. Hashing as well as linking are the domains of safety in blockchain. A brief idea, of the hashing algorithmic rules have been understood by the user in the previous experiment (experiment no.2). For appending the blocks in the blockchain, the miners are provided with some tricky mathematical puzzles. The first miner to solve the puzzle, gets a reward that is based on some policy. One must understand that there should be enough computational power to solve that tricky mathematical puzzle.
                     After the solving of the puzzle, the blocks get added to chain thus forming blockchain.<br>
                     Proof of work is a consensus algorithm in blockchain technology. In Blockchain, miners use this algorithm to confirm transactions and create new blocks in the blockchain. With proof of work, miners try and compete against others to confirm the transaction in less time to get rewarded. For that miners have to solve a complex mathematical puzzle. 
                     Bitcoin is the most famous application of proof of work. In Blockchain it takes 10 minutes for the creation of Blockchain. 
    <h4>Proof of Stake</h4>
                     It is an alternative measure to the Proof of Work (Pow). To achieve the objective of the distributed consensus this algorithmic rule can be used. In this mechanism, the validation of blocks takes place. PoS is somehow, less risky in comparison to the other protocol mentioned. Everything under this mechanism, holds a principle that “Proportions of Coins held by the miner”.<br>The Proof of Stake (PoS) seeks to address this issue by attributing mining power to the proportion of coins held by a miner. This way, instead of utilizing energy to answer PoW puzzles, a PoS miner is limited to mining a percentage of transactions that is reflective of his or her ownership stake.With a PoS, the attacker would need to obtain 51% of the cryptocurrency to carry out a 51% attack. The Proof of Stake avoids this by making it disadvantageous for a miner with a 51% stake in a cryptocurrency to attack the network.
                     <br><br>
<h3>What Is a Consensus Mechanism?</h3>
                    A consensus mechanism is a fault-tolerant mechanism that is used in computer and blockchain systems to achieve the necessary
                    agreement on a single data value or a single state of the network among distributed processes or multi-agent systems, 
                    such as with cryptocurrencies. It is useful in record-keeping, among other things.
                    
 <h4>Smart-Contracts in Blockchain</h4>
The origin of the Smart-Contract began in the early 1990's by a versatile computer scientist "Nick Szabo". He is also an expert of the cryptographic domain. With the help of this concept, the user or anyone can avoid the  frauds of a middle men. It can allow anyone to trade currency, property or any valuable thing in a hassle-free manner. The user can compare it with a concept of C-Language i.e. "if-else statement". Same here happens, If one condition is fulfilled,then a particular condition will take place and if a particular condition is not met then, some other task will take place. The smart contracts are commited as codes. That simply means that, when an outline of an event takes place the smart contracts are triggered. For example, if in a corporate private organization, the targets are reached then the bonus will be given to the employees. Here, the bonus is basically the process happened when the code of target is completed. Syntactically, the principle is "if/when....then...", that means if a particular condition is met then a particular action will take place.
<h3>Advantages of Smart Contracts</h3>
There are basically 5 benifits of Smart Contracts that are discussed below:<br>
1.  Pace<br>
2.  Correctness<br>
3.  Belief<br>
4.  Certainty<br>
5.  Economizing<br>
